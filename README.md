# OpenSource-Limitimer

This code is a simple HTML webpage that serves as a Limitimer System. The webpage displays a countdown timer that can be set by the user to a desired time in minutes. The timer starts counting down as soon as the user inputs a time and clicks the "Start" button. The timer's display updates every 10 milliseconds with the remaining time in minutes and seconds. The background color of the entire page changes based on the remaining time, with green indicating more than 2 minutes remaining, yellow indicating between 1 and 2 minutes remaining, and red indicating less than 1 minute remaining. Once the timer reaches zero, the timer display changes to "Time's up!" and the background color of the page changes to black with white text. The user can also input a new time to start a new countdown at any time. Additionally, all the text on the page is centered to make the timer more noticeable.
